What is needed to do for mari&maru volleyball game


#1
gravity
- gravity can code by accelation implementation.


#2
collision detection
-Im gonna use SAT argorism same as box2d code.
SAT(Seperating Axis Theorem)
-May need solver -RK4, Bisection ..else
verlet argorithm? = d+1 = d + vt 

#3
Joint constraint
-center net will be sigle or serise of joint so joint is needed

#4
Spring and dampers
-Spring will generate reactino move when collision situations. some damping for natural elastic movement.

I think circles can solve most of situations
